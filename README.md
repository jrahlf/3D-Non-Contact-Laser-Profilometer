Laser-Profilometer
==================

Code for a stm32f4 microcontroller (dev board) to control an XY stage and interact with Keyence LT-9010 laser profilometer to create 3D scans of surfaces.

Requires the C++ framework xpcc.

Uses cascaded PID controller to control DC brushed motors equipped with optical rotary encoders.
