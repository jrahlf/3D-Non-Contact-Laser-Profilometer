	 * \brief	Driver for KS0108 based LC-displays
	 * 
	 * One KS0108 can control 64x64 pixels. Therefore two chips are needed
	 * for a normal 128x64 pixel display. One chip controls the left half, the
	 * other the right half (see PIN_CS1 and PIN_CS2).
	 * 
	 * \tparam	E		Enable Pin
	 * \tparam	RW		Read/Write-Select Pin (Low = write, High = read)
	 * \tparam	RS		Command/Data-Select Pin
	 * 					(Low = instruction, High = data)
	 * \tparam	PIN_CS1	Chip-Select 1
	 * \tparam	PIN_CS2	Chip-Select 2 
	 * \tparam	PORT	Needs to be a 8-Bit Port. See xpcc::gpio::Port() or
	 * 					GPIO__PORT() for more details.
