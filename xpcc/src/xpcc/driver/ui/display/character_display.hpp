	 * \brief	Base class for alpha-numeric LCDs (liquid crystal display)
	 * 
	 * <h3>About this implementation:</h3> 
	 * 
	 * In contrast to other drivers which use static methods,
	 * this class is directly derived from IODevice with all the virtual
	 * methods because it will be most likely used to create a IOStream
	 * which then handles the output to the display.
	 * 
	 * Therefore creating this class with static methods and using a wrapper
	 * class to create a IODevice seems unnecessary complicated.
