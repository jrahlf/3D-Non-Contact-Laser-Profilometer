 *
 * \brief Simple to use classes for implementing menu structures
 *        on graphic displays.
 *
 * Some convenience classes for implementing menus. The menus are
 * using a stack to allow stepping forward and backwards through the
 * screens.
 * The menus are based on the usage of five buttons. Inside most of the
 * screens these buttons have the following functions:
 * Left: Go back one screen.
 * Right: Go to next screen.
 * Up: Go to previous selected entry on screen
 * Down: Go to next entry on screen
 * OK: Edit selected entry
 *
 *\warning Some classes currently only work with the font
 *         xpcc::font::FixedWidth5x8
