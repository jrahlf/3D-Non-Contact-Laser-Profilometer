	/**
	 * \brief SCP1000-D01 absolute pressure sensor driver
	 *
	 * The SCP1000 sensor measures both absolute pressure in Pa as well as
	 * temperature in degrees Celsius.
	 *
	 * The sensor has 4 measurement modes plus standby and power down mode.
	 * In all measurement modes, the pressure output word-length is 19 bits
	 * and the temperature output word-length is 14 bits.
	 *
\verbatim
Measurement Mode: refresh | pressure | temperature
High Resolution :  1.8Hz  |  17bit   |   14bit
High Speed      :   ~9Hz  |  15bit   |   14bit
Ultra Low Power :   ~1Hz  |  15bit   |   14bit
\endverbatim
	 * 
	 * DRDY pin pulled high, when new data is available.
	 * DRDY pin pulled low, when DATARD16 is being read.
	 *
	 * You do not have to read out the temperature as it is only used by the
	 * sensor for internal calculations, but it is important to read the 
	 * 16 bit pressure register as the last one in the cycle.
	 * A typical reading sequence: TEMPOUT => DATARD8 => DATARD16
	 *
	 * For further information on how to process the sensors data, consult the
	 * <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SCP1000-D01.pdf">
	 * datasheet</a>.
