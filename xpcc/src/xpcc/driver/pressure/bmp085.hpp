	 * \brief BMP085 digital absolute pressure sensor driver
	 *
	 * The BMP085 is a high precision digital pressure sensor with I2C interface.
	 * Unfortunately this sensor is so sensitive, it will give you wrong results
	 * when there is traffic on the I2C during either temperature or pressure
	 * conversion. So during that time make sure no other sensors on the bus
	 * are read out.
	 *
	 * For further information, consult the
	 * <a href="http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/downloads/BST-BMP085-DS000-06.pdf">
	 * datasheet</a>.
