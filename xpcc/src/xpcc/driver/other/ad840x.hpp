	 * \brief	AD8400/2/3 Digital Potentiometers (1-,2-,4-Channel)
	 * 
	 * <h2>Features</h2>
	 * 
	 *  - 256-position variable resistance device
	 *  - Replaces 1, 2, or 4 potentiometers
	 *  - 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 50 kΩ, 100 kΩ nominal resistance
	 *  - 3-wire, SPI-compatible serial data input
	 *  - 10 MHz update data loading rate
	 *  - 2.7 V to 5.5 V single-supply operation
	 * 
	 * The nominal resistance of the VR (Variable Resistor) (RDAC) between
	 * Terminal A and Terminal B is available with values of 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ,
	 * 50 kΩ, and 100 kΩ. The final digits of the part number determine the
	 * nominal resistance value; that is, 10 kΩ = 10; 100 kΩ = 100 etc.
	 * 
	 * The nominal resistance (RAB) of the VR has 256 contact points accessible
	 * by the wiper terminal. The AD840x do not have power-on midscale preset,
	 * so the wiper can be at any random position at power-up.
	 * 
	 * <h2>Serial Connection</h2>
	 * 
	 * Data is shifted in on the positive edges of the clock (SPI Mode 0).
	 * Maximum SPI frequency is 10 MHz.
	 * 
	 * The output is updated after the time ts after the rising edge of CS.
	 * ts depends on the nominal resistance value.
	 * 
	 * \code
	 * Version | Time ts
	 * --------+---------
	 *   10 kΩ |   2 µs
	 *   50 kΩ |   9 µs
	 *  100 kΩ |  18 µs
	 * \endcode
	 * 
	 * The serial data output (SDO) pin, which exists only on the AD8403 and
	 * not on the AD8400 or AD8402, contains an open-drain, n-channel FET that
	 * requires a pull-up resistor to transfer data to the SDI pin of the next
	 * package.
	 * 
	 * The pull-up resistor termination voltage may be larger than the VDD
	 * supply (but less than the max VDD of 8 V) of the AD8403 SDO output
	 * device.
	 * 
	 * \tparam	Spi		SPI interface (MISO pin is not used)
	 * \tparam	Cs		Chip-Select pin
	 * \tparam	Rs		Reset (low active), use xpcc::Unused for the AD8400
	 * \tparam	Shdn	Shutdown (low active), use xpcc::Unused for the AD8400

		 * Terminal Bx, resulting in the consumption of only the leakage
		 * current in the VR.

		 * The wiper’s first connection starts at the B terminal for data 00H.
		 * This B terminal connection has a wiper contact resistance of 50 Ω.
		 * The second connection (for the 10 kΩ part) is the first tap point
		 * located at 89 Ω = [RAB (nominal resistance) + RW = 39 Ω + 50 Ω] for
		 * data 01H.
		 * The third connection is the next tap point representing
		 * 78 Ω + 50 Ω = 128 Ω for data 02H. Each LSB data value increase
		 * moves the wiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap point is
		 * reached at 10,011 Ω.
		 * 
		 * Note that the wiper does not directly connect to the B terminal
		 * even for data 00H.

		 *    0 |   10 050  | Zero-scale
		 * \endcode
		 * 
		 * It is possible to set up all four channels at once by using the
		 * shutdown mode and then setting all four channels individually. After
		 * resuming normal operation the wipers will take their new positions.
