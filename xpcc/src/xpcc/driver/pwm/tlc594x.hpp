	/**
	 * \brief	TLC594* multi-channel, daisy-chainable, constant-current sink, 12bit PWM LED driver.
	 *
	 * This class does not use the DCPRG pin, as writing to the EEPROM requires
	 * 22V to be applied to Vprog, requiring additional external circuits.
	 * Use of any EEPROM functions is therefore not implemented here.
	 * Make sure that pin is connected to Vcc, otherwise Dot Correction does not work.
	 * 
	 * This class also does not control the BLANK pin, as the setup of the timer
	 * to drive that pin is platform and configuration specific.
	 * Switching off all LEDs using one command is not implemented here.
	 *
	 * This driver can be used for the 16-channel TLC5940 and 24-channel TLC5947
	 * and probably similar TLC59s as well, simply by adjusting the number of
	 * CHANNELS.
	 * Therefore this class can also be used with daisy-chained TLC59s, e.g.
	 * to control two TLC5940s set CHANNELS to 2*16.
	 *
	 * ####  WARNING  ####
	 *
	 * Each channel in the TLC594x chip drives a transistor using a feedback loop
	 * to make it meet a particular current requirement.
	 * If a channel is disconnected, the feedback loop will fully drive the transistor.
	 * If most of the channels are disconnected (quite common in a testing
	 * environment if not in production), this will end up pulling quite a bit 
	 * of power from the chip's 3.3 or 5v supply.
	 * This can heat up the chip and cause power supply issues.
	 *
	 *
	 * \tparam CHANNELS	Number of channels must be multiples of 4, adjust for daisy-chained chips
	 * \tparam	Spi		Spi interface
	 * \tparam	Xlat	Level triggered latch pin
	 * \tparam	Vprog	Vprog pin, use xpcc::gpio::Unused if not connected
	 * \tparam	Xerr	Error pin, use xpcc::gpio::Unused if not connected
	 *
