		 * This class is an implementation of xpcc::i2c::Delegate which,
		 * when passed to an i2c driver, performs the sequence:
		 * start - address - write - stop.
		 *
		 * After initialization and performing operation this class remains
		 * holding references to passed buffers and may be reused again without
		 * reinitialization as long the passed buffers remain valid.
		 *
		 * While process is ongoing getState returns BUSY. Reinitialization
		 * is not permitted during this phase.
		 *
		 * Example:
		 * \code
		 * // instantiation of the delegate and creating of buffers somewhere
		 * // at a persistent place at least during operation is ongoing
		 * xpcc::i2c::WriteAdapter delegate;
		 * YourType buffer;
		 *
		 * // initialization of the delegate
		 * // (WriteAdapter does not need to be initializated each time it
		 * // is used if address, buffer and it's size don't change. However the content
		 * // of the buffer may change, but not during operation.)
		 * bool b = delegate.initialize(slaveAddress, buffer, sizeof(YourType))
		 *
		 * // try to start the transaction
		 * bool c = b && OneI2CMaster::start(&delegate);
		 *
		 * if c wait until delegate.getState != delegate.BUSY
		 *  check if delegate.getState is delegate.NO_ERROR to be shure transaction
		 *  has been completed successfully.
		 * else
		 * 	delegate has not been attached either because module was busy or
		 * 	delegate is already attached.
		 *
		 * \endcode
