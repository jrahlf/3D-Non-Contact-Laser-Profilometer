	 * \brief	Fast data exchange between two microcontrollers via USART.
	 * 
	 * The class can be configured with the \c project.cfg file. Example:
	 * \code
	 * [defines]
	 * INTERCONNECT_USART_PORT	 = D
	 * INTERCONNECT_USART_ID	 = 1
	 * INTERCONNECT_PIN_OUTPUT	 = D,5
	 * INTERCONNECT_PIN_INPUT	 = D,4
	 * \endcode
	 * 
	 * Or you can use the predefined values for the CPU Board by defining
	 * CPU_BOARD2_MASTER = 1 or CPU_BOARD2_SLAVE = 1. 
	 * 
	 * Resources used:
	 * - DMA Channel 0 is used to transmit Data
	 * - DMA Channel 1 is used to receive Data
	 * - INT0 of the Port connected to the input pin (see INTERCONNECT_PIN_INPUT) is
	 * 	 used to check when data was received.
	 * 
	 * \warning	Medium level interrupts and interrupts in general must be enabled!
	 *
