	/**
	 * \brief	Type safe interface for the interconnect link
	 * 
	 * The connected of the Transmit and Receive structs (T & R) are updated
	 * should be updated periodically. Simple sensor data can therefore directly
	 * stored within the structs.
	 * 
	 * More care needs to be taken when it comes to commands. The simplest and
	 * most reliable way is to transmit command with two counters. One controlled
	 * by the first node and one controlled by the second node.
	 * 
	 * When a command should be executed the counter is incremented by one.
	 * Parameters may also be stored in the transmit struct. The other node
	 * keeps a copy of the counter value and compares it to the received counter
	 * on every update.
	 * When the counter changes, it extecutes the corresponding command und
	 * stores the new counter value. This way it is made sure that the command
	 * is executed only once. To signal that the command is finished the
	 * counter in the other direction is used. The node sets the value of that
	 * counter to value of the counter received by the other node.
	 * 
	 * The transmitting node must now only check if the received counter equals
	 * the transmitted counter to know when the command was successfully executed.
	 * 
	 * <h2>Example</h2>
	 * 
	 * Definition of the two counters and the paramter field:
	 * \include interconnect_struct.cpp
	 * 
	 * Master:
	 * \include interconnect_master.cpp
	 * 
	 * Slave:
	 * \include interconnect_slave.cpp
	 * 
	 * <h2>FAQ:</h2>
	 * 
	 * You get an error message during linking saying something like:
	 * \code
	 * undefined reference to `xpcc::InterconnectLink::sizeReceiveBuffer'
	 * undefined reference to `xpcc::InterconnectLink::sizeTransmitBuffer'
	 * ...
	 * \endcode
	 * 
	 * Check that all necessary defines are set in the project file. This may
	 * either be CPU_BOARD2_MASTER/CPU_BOARD2_SLAVE when compiling for the
	 * CPU Board2 or the following:
	 * - INTERCONNECT_USART_PORT
	 * - INTERCONNECT_USART_ID
	 * - INTERCONNECT_PIN_OUTPUT
	 * - INTERCONNECT_PIN_INPUT
	 * 
	 * INTERCONNECT_USART_PORT and INTERCONNECT_USART_ID specifiy the used
	 * USART interface, INTERCONNECT_PIN_OUTPUT and INTERCONNECT_PIN_INPUT are
	 * two status pins which need to be connected crossover to the other
	 * microcontroller.
	 * 
	 * Example for the ATxmega128a1 (from the \c project.cfg file):
	 * \code
	 * [defines]
	 * INTERCONNECT_USART_PORT = C
	 * INTERCONNECT_USART_ID   = 0
	 * INTERCONNECT_PIN_OUTPUT = C,0
	 * INTERCONNECT_PIN_INPUT  = C,1
	 * \endcode
