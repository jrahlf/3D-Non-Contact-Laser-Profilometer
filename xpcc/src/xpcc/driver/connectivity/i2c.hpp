 * \defgroup	i2c		(I2C) Inter-Integrated Circuit
 * 
 * I2C is a synchronous protocol that allows a master device to initiate
 * communication with a slave device. Data is exchanged between these devices.
 * It was invented by Philips to attach low-speed peripherals to a motherboard,
 * embedded system or other devices.
 * 
 * The I2C bus consists of two lines: Clock and Data with a strong pull-up
 * resistor (usually 4.7kOhm) on each. A logical 0 is signified by actively
 * pulling the line low (open collector output) and a logical 1 is signified
 * by passively leaving the line high (hi-Z). Standard communication speed
 * is up to 100kHz and high speed is up to 400 kHz. The maximum communication
 * speed is affected by the line capacitance and EMI.
 * 
 * After every 8 bits of data transferred a 1 bit handshake is performed to
 * indicate success ... an ACK is generated by pulling the line low (logical 0).
 * A NACK is signified by leaving the line high (logical 1).
