 * \brief		Lightweight, stackless threads
 * 
 * Protothreads are extremely lightweight stackless threads designed for
 * severely memory constrained systems, such as small embedded systems or
 * wireless sensor network nodes. Protothreads provide linear code execution
 * for event-driven systems implemented in C. Protothreads can be used with or
 * without an underlying operating system to provide blocking event-handlers.
 * 
 * Protothreads provide sequential flow of control without complex state
 * machines or full multi-threading. 
 * 
 * As they implement some kind of cooperative multithreading 
 * Protothreads are non-preemptable. Therefore, a context switch can only take
 * place on blocking operations. Therefore you don't need complex
 * synchronisation. Protothreads are also stackless, which means
 * member variables of the xpcc::Protothread subclasses are needed for
 * preserving variables across context switches.
 * 
 * A protothread runs within a single function (xpcc::Protothread::run()) and 
 * cannot span over other functions. A protothread may call normal functions,
 * but cannot block inside a called function. Blocking inside nested function
 * calls is instead made by spawning a separate protothread for each
 * potentially blocking function.
 * 
 * The protothread concept was developed by Adam Dunkels and Oliver Schmidt.
 * 
 * Originally ported to C++ for use by Hamilton Jet (www.hamiltonjet.co.nz) by
 * Ben Hoyt, but stripped down for public release. See his blog entry about
 * it for more information: http://blog.micropledge.com/2008/07/protothreads/
