		 * Counting semaphore.
		 * 
		 * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
		 * 
		 * -# Counting events. \n
		 *    In this usage scenario an event handler will 'release' a semaphore
		 *    each time an event occurs (incrementing the semaphore count
		 *    value), and a handler thread will 'acquire' a semaphore each time it
		 *    processes an event (decrementing the semaphore count value). The
		 *    count value is therefore the difference between the number of
		 *    events that have occurred and the number that have been
		 *    processed. In this case it is desirable for the initial count
		 *    value to be zero.
		 * 
		 * -# Resource management.
		 *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of
		 *    resources available. To obtain control of a resource a thread must
		 *    first obtain a semaphore - decrementing the semaphore count
		 *    value. When the count value reaches zero there are no free
		 *    resources. When a thread finishes with the resource it 'gives' the
		 *    semaphore back (release()) - incrementing the semaphore count value.
		 *    In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be
		 *    equal to the maximum count value, indicating that all resources
		 *    are free.
