		 * \brief	A very lightweight, stackless thread
		 * 
		 * Because protothreads do not save the stack context across a blocking
		 * call, local variables are not preserved when the protothread blocks.
		 * This means that local variables should be used with utmost care - if in
		 * doubt, do not use local variables inside a protothread! Use
		 * private/protected member variables to save state between a context switch.
		 * 
		 * A protothread is driven by repeated calls to the run()-function in which
		 * the protothread is running. Each time the function is called, the
		 * protothread will run until it blocks or exits. Thus the scheduling of
		 * protothreads is done by the application that uses protothreads.
		 * 
		 * Example:
		 * \code
		 * #include <xpcc/architecture.hpp>
		 * #include <xpcc/utils/protothread.hpp>
		 * #include <xpcc/utils/timeout.hpp>
		 * 
		 * GPIO__OUTPUT(Led, B, 0);

		 *     {
		 *         PT_BEGIN();
		 *         
		 *         // set everything up
		 *         Led::setOutput();
		 *         Led::set();
		 *         
		 *         while (true)
		 *         {
		 *             this->timer.start(100);
		 *             Led::set();
		 *             PT_WAIT_UNTIL(this->timer.isExpired());
		 *             
		 *             this->timer.start(200);
		 *             Led::reset();
		 *             PT_WAIT_UNTIL(this->timer.isExpired());
		 *         }
