	 * \brief	Class for handling common point operations
	 * 
	 * Basic data type of all geometric operations. Used to represent vectors
	 * as well as particular points in the coordinate system.
	 * 
	 * \section	point_vector	Point vs. vector
	 * 
	 * In geometry, it is often convenient to use vector arithmetic to
	 * represent points.
	 * 
	 * A vector, by its definition, has no fixed starting point, but if we
	 * imagine the starting point of a vector to be the origin, then the
	 * endpoint of the vector represents a particular point.
	 * 
	 * In this manner, every vector can be said to identify a unique point,
	 * which is the endpoint of the vector when its starting point is the
	 * origin.
	 * 
	 * Therefore there isn't a Point-class, but only a Vector class.
	 * 
	 * Adapted from the implementation of Gaspard Petit (gaspardpetit@gmail.com).
