		 * \brief	Add a increment only in x-direction
		 * 
		 * Our robots mostly use a differential drive with two driven wheels
		 * side by side, allowing the robot to move only in the drive direction
		 * (x-direction in the local coordinate system of the robot) and
		 * rotate. A movement perpendicular to the drive direction is
		 * impossible without an external force.
		 * 
		 * To estimate the position of the robot over time, we use odometry.
		 * Therefore it is necessary to add a lot small increments of
		 * movement over time.
		 * Because the y-component will always be zero, we created this
		 * method, which avoids unnecessary computations for the y-component
		 * and is therefore faster the the universal move-method.

		 * \param	x		movement in x-direction
