		 * \brief	Generic ADC wrapper for analog sensors.
		 *
		 * This template class stores 16bit ADC values in a buffer and 
		 * provides an easy interface for managing that data.
		 *			
		 * The code will read the ADC channels you specify in an array.
		 * This means you can remap the ADC channels in the order that they
		 * should appear in the buffer.
		 * The array must obviously have as many elements as channels!
		 * For example, if channels 0,2,7 are connected, but the sensors
		 * are in the wrong order, just remap them with the array {7,0,2}.
		 *
		 * To make use of oversampling and averaging, set SAMPLES > 0.
		 * This will loop 2^SAMPLES times through the ADC channels, adding
		 * the average of each result to the buffer.
		 * Be aware that averaging more than 64 values (SAMPLES>6) could cause
		 * a 16bit overflow depending on your ADC values (10bit * 64 = 16bit).
