 * \defgroup	atxmega_dma	Direct Memory Access Controller
 * 
 * The XMEGA has a Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller to move data between
 * memories and peripherals in the data space. The DMA controller uses the same
 * data bus as the CPU to transfer data.
 *
 * It has 4 channels that can be configured independently. Each DMA channel can
 * perform data transfers in blocks of configurable size from 1 to 64K bytes. A
 * repeat counter can be used to repeat each block transfer for single
 * transactions up to 16M bytes. Each DMA channel can be configured to access
 * the source and destination memory address with incrementing, decrementing or
 * static addressing. The addressing is independent for source and destination
 * address. When the transaction is complete the original source and destination
 * address can automatically be reloaded to be ready for the next transaction.
 *
 * The DMAC can access all the peripherals through their I/O memory registers,
 * and the DMA may be used for automatic transfer of data to/from communication
 * modules, as well as automatic data retrieval from ADC conversions, data
 * transfer to DAC conversions, or data transfer to or from port pins. A wide
 * range of transfer triggers is available from the peripherals, Event System
 * and software. Each DMA channel has different transfer triggers.
