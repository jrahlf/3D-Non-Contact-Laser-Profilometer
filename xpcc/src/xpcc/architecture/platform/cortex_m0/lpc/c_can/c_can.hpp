	 * \brief	The CAN bus driver for LPC11Cxx devices.
	 *
	 * The C_CAN block is available in LPC11Cxx parts only (LPC11C00 series).
	 * The LPC11C22 and LPC11C24 parts include an on-chip, high-speed transceiver.
	 * For these parts, the CAN_RXD and CAN_TXD signals are connected internally
	 * to the on-chip transceiver, and the transceiver signals are pinned out.
	 *
	 * This class uses the on-chip CAN drivers.
	 *
	 * There are 32 Message Objects in two groups of 16 Message Objects.
	 * (1 to 16 and 17 to 32).
	 *
	 * In this class the following assumption is made:
	 * Message Objects  1 to 16 are used for reception and
	 * Message Objects 17 to 32 are used for transmission.
	 *
	 * TODO Group Message Objects to a FIFO ?! p307 section 16.7.3.10.1
	 *
	 * TODO Filter
	 *
	 * TODO Configuration
	 *
