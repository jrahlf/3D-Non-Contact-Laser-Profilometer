		 * \brief	Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART1)
		 *
		 * This implementation uses the hardware buffer and the software buffer.
		 * A software buffer is only used if more than 16 bytes of buffering
		 * is requested.
		 *
		 * The hardware implementation by NXP is flawed. See
		 *   http://knowledgebase.nxp.com/showthread.php?t=2231
		 *
		 * There is no FIFO-not-full flag. It's only possible to check if the
		 * FIFO is completely empty. This makes it impossible to add data
		 * to the FIFO after the first byte is put into the FIFO.
		 *
		 * After detecting that the FIFO is empty (THRE interrupt) the
		 * charsLeft variable is set to 16 (= size of FIFO) and some accounting
		 * is done in this class.
		 *
		 * The interrupt occurence is strongly reduced compared to STM devices.
		 * In STM devices after each char transmitted an interrupt is called.
		 * In this implementation only every 16 bytes an interrupt is generated.
