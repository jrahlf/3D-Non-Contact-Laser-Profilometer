		 * @brief		Three-channel 16-bit Timer/Counter Channel 0 (TC)
		 *
		 * Each channel is organized around a 16-bit counter. The value of the
		 * counter is incremented at each positive edge of the selected clock.
		 * 
		 * Each channel can independently operate in two different modes:
		 * - Capture Mode provides measurement on signals.
 	 	 * - Waveform Mode provides wave generation.
 	 	 * 
		 * In Capture Mode, TIOA and TIOB are configured as inputs.
		 * In Waveform Mode, TIOA is always configured to be an output and
		 * TIOB is an output if it is not selected to be the external trigger.
		 * 
		 * @attention	Not yet implemented!
