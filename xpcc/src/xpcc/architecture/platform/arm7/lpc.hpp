 * - USB, I2S, and SD/MMC interface options 
 * - 10-bit ADC and DAC options 
 * - Low power consumption
 * - LQFP48-package (LPC210x) up to LQFP208 (LPC24xx) 
 * - 5V-tolerant IOs
 * - two voltages needed:
 *   - 3,0-3,6V IO voltage
 *   - 1,65-1,95V core voltage
 * 
 * Devices:
 * - LPC2101, LPC2102, and LPC2103 Low-Cost, Tiny MCUs
 * - LPC214x Full-Speed USB 2.0 Device MCUs
 * - LPC23xx Dual AHB Bus MCUs
 * - LPC24xx Dual AHB Bus MCUs with External Memory Interface
 * 
 * <h2>LPC210x/LPC22xx/LPC21xx vs. LPC23xx/LPC24xx</h2>
 * 
 * The LPC2000 series consists of two main types: The older LPC210x/LPC22xx/LPC21xx
 * devices and the newer, improved LPC23xx/LPC24xx devices. As there are
 * some differences concerning the clock nets, interrupt controller or DMA
 * channels, a define (\c __ARM_LPC23_24__) is available to identify the device
 * type.
