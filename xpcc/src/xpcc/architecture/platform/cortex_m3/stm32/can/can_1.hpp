		 * @brief		Basic Extended CAN1
		 * 
		 * The Basic Extended CAN peripheral, named bxCAN, interfaces the CAN
		 * network. It supports the CAN protocols version 2.0A and B. It has
		 * been designed to manage a high number of incoming messages
		 * efficiently with a minimum CPU load.
		 * 
		 * <h2>Filter</h2>
		 * 
		 * For connectivity line devices there are 28 filter banks,
		 * i=0 .. 27, in other devices there are 14 filter banks i = 0 ..13.
		 * 
		 * The 28 filter banks for the connectivity line devices are
		 * shared between CAN1 and CAN2.
		 * 
		 * <h2>Configuration</h2>
