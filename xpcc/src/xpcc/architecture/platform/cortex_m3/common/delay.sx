	 * @brief	Simple delay loop (in microseconds resolution)
	 * 
	 * Use Timer-Interrupts etc. for delays whenever possible. This delay-loop
	 * is very inaccurate when interrupts or DMA transfers occur at the same
	 * time. This is because only the number of cycles inside this loop are
	 * counted. External interruptions go unnoticed and will prolong the delay
	 * time.
	 * 
	 * C equivalent:
	 * @code
	 * extern "C" void _delay_us(uint32_t us);
	 * @endcode
	 * 
	 * The function is put into the .fastcode section which resides in RAM to
	 * be sure that it is executed without any waitstates etc. Otherwise
	 * the delay variables had to be adapted every ARM type.
	 * 
	 * An example are the AT91SAM types, which aren't able to run ARM code from
	 * Flash at above 20-30 Mhz without wait-states. Of course this changes
	 * the executing timing which we would like to avoid here to get
	 * at least an reasonably accurate delay. 
	 *
