 * 
 * STM32 is a family of 32-bits ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers developed and
 * marketed by STMicroelectronics.
 * 
 * Supported Devices:
 * - STM32 F1 series of mainstream MCUs
 *   - Performance line STM32F103  - 72 MHz, up to 1 Mbyte Flash with motor
 *     control, USB and CAN
 *   - Connectivity line STM32F105/107 - 72 MHz CPU with Ethernet MAC, CAN
 *     and USB 2.0 OTG
 * - TODO: STM32 F2 series of high-performance MCUs
 * - TODO: STM32 F3 series of high-performance MCUs with DSP and FPU instructions and analog peripherals
 * - TODO: STM32 F4 series of high-performance MCUs with DSP and FPU instructions
 *
 * Defines:
 * - Frequencies: These defines are defined as maximum possible frequencies of
 * 	 the busses. Hardware drivers like USARTs are using them for configuration.
 * 	 Remember, you can override defines in the defines section of your project.cfg
 * 	 if you need.
 *   - STM32_AHB_FREQUENCY
 *   - STM32_APB1_FREQUENCY
 *   - STM32_APB2_FREQUENCY
 *
 *
 * The Value line (STM32F100-102) is not supported!
