/**
 * \ingroup		platform

 * 
 * Tested with Codesourcery G++ lite.
 * 
 * <h2>Configuration</h2>
 * 
 * The following defines are available:
 * - \c ARM7_ENABLE_ABORT_HANDLER set to \c 1 to enable a handler for data and
 *   prefetch abort and undefined instruction conditions. This handler uses
 *   the xpcc::log::error stream for output, which needs to be a \b none
 *   interrupt-driven output stream (for example xpcc::at91::Debug).
 *   During the execution of the abort handler interrupts are disabled.
 *   
 *   The default handler without output just enters an infinite loop.
 * 
 *
