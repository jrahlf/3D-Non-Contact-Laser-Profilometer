	 * 
	 * This class is implemented using \c gettimeofday() from <sys/time.h> for
	 * any Unix-OS. 
	 * 
	 * For the AVRs targets the user has to use the increment() method to
	 * generate a suitable timebase, preferably by incrementing the time
	 * value inside a timer interrupt function.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * \code
	 * // Interrupt every 1ms
	 * ISR(TIMER)
	 * {
	 *     xpcc::Clock::increment();
	 * }
	 * \endcode
