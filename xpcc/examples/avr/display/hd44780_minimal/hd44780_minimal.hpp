	/**
	 * \brief	Driver for HD447800 compatible displays
	 * 
	 * An HD44780 Character LCD is a de facto industry standard liquid crystal
	 * display (LCD) display device. These screens come in common
	 * configurations of 8x1, which is one row of eight characters, 16x2, and
	 * 20x4, among others.
	 * 
	 * This driver uses the 4-Bit mode with read back. Therefore you need to
	 * connect all there control pins (RW, RS, E) and the high nibble of the
	 * data lines.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * \include lcd/hd44780/main.cpp
	 * 
	 * \tparam	E		Enable Pin
	 * \tparam	RW		Read/Write-Select Pin
	 * \tparam	RS		Command/Data-Select Pin
	 * \tparam	DATA	Needs to be a Nibble. See Nibble() for more details.
	 * 
	 * \see		Lcd
	 * \see		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD44780_Character_LCD
	 *
