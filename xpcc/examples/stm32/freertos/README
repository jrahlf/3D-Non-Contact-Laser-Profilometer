Example for the [STM32_P103][1] board from Olimex.

It requires two additional LEDs at PA1 and PA8 and a DOGS102 Display connected
to SPI1.

The example uses three Tasks. One to draws a moving hand on a circle and some
fonts on the display. The second flashes the Status LED on PA0. The third
toggles the LED at PA8 synchronized to the second task via a binary
semaphore.

The third LED (at PA1) is connected to the Wake-Up-Button from within
the display task.
