CAN Example
===========

Example for the [STM32_P103][1] board from Olimex.
CAN1 (at PB8 and PB9) is connected to a CAN Bus via a MCP2551.

After startup the boards sends one 11-bit message with identifier 1 and zero
data bytes. Afterwards it send a batch of 16 extended messages with identifier
12345678 and one data byte. This byte gives the order in which the messages
where put in the send buffer.

Then the program waits for incomming CAN messages and display them on the
connected DOGS102 display if they match the filter conditions.

- 12345678 no rtr

- 123 no rtr
