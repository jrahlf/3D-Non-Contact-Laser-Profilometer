Template for a new project
==========================

Example for the [STM32_P103][1] board from Olimex, but it can be used with
any other Board that features a LED :-)

Requires a 8 MHz crystal and sets the main clock to 72 MHz (from within
the startup Code).

If you want to create a new STM32 project just copy the files in this folder
to your new project, change the "rootpath" variable to point to the
xpcc-folder and your good to go.
