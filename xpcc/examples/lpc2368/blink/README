This is a development board with an LPC2368 in TQFP100. It 
features USB connection, RTC, Ethernet, CAN, RS232, RS422, RS485, 
piezo speaker, SD card slot, LEDs push buttons, potentiometers and
an LCD connector. The crystal frequency is 12 MHz. 

Flash Command
-------------
~/rca/lpc21isp/lpc21isp -wipe build/blink.hex /dev/ttyUSB0 38400 12000

OpenOCD
-------
OpenOCD works with busblaster. 
$ openocd -f openocd.cfg
$ telnet localhost 4444
> reset halt
> bp 0x420 4 hw
> resume
> reg
> step
et cetera

Results as of 2012-06-10
------------------------
After a long delay (about 5 seconds), the processor starts the external oscillator. 
A 12 MHz signal can be observed at the crystal. 

It then initialises the PLL and runs the processor core at 72 MHz. 

Then the LEDs P3.25 and P3.26 start flashing. 
P3.26 is on for 900msec and then P3.25 is on for 100msec. 

Input P4.28 was successfully tested. 

Knwon Issues
------------
The device takes very long to start up because in low_level_init.sx a 
long loop at the beginning of _lowLevelInit.
 
This is good for debugging startup code.
